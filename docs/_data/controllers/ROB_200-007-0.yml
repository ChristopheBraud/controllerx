note: >-
  Note that each button perform the same actions.
  This is because ControllerX is design to control just one entity (light or media player).
  So you can include the `actions` parameter to include the actions needed,
  or use the `mapping` attribute to define a <a href="/controllerx/advanced/custom-controllers">custom mapping</a>.
  You can check <a href="https://github.com/xaviml/controllerx/issues/18#issuecomment-582535634">here</a> for reference.
  This controller is a white-label version of the Sunricher SR-ZG9001K8-DIM.
