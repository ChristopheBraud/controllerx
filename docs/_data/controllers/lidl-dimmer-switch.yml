note: >-
  In case of working with <strong>z2m</strong> and wanting to use the multiclick functionality, then
  you need to make sure to remove from the device specific (devices.yaml) the
  `multiple_press_timeout` option.

  In case of <strong>deCONZ</strong>, all the click actions are mapped with X002 actions, so when the
  button is released after being clicked.
