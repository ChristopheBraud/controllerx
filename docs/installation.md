# Installation

## HACS

The easiest way to add this to your Homeassistant installation is using HACS with Appdaemon enabled. And then follow the instructions under Configuration below.

## Manual

Download the `controllerx` directory from inside the `apps` directory here to your local `apps` directory, then add the configuration to enable the `controllerx` module.

# Update

Note that AppDaemon will need to be restarted when installing a new version of ControllerX. This is due to AppDaemon not reimporting the modules again. If AppDaemon server is not restarted, then it will keep executing the old version.
